Hi! My name is Margarita and I am a first year Industrial Engineering student here at Georgia Tech. I am part of a living learning community on campus an am involved in clubs like investment committee, Undergraduate Consulting Club, SCNO, and GT Data Science. I love to bake, hike, and used to be a figure skater. Looking forward to learning Java this semester :)
